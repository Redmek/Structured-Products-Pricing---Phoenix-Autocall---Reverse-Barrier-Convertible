# Structured-Products-Pricing---Phoenix-Autocall---Reverse-Barrier-Convertible

Structured products with so-called "performance enhancement" are exposed to
a higher risk than products with capital protection, for example, as the capital
invested here is not fully guaranteed. The investorâ€™s participation in the positive
performance of the underlying is limited, but in case of a negative performance, the
participation in the negative performance can be total. As this type of product is
riskier, the expected return for the investor is higher: a higher risk generally results
in a higher expected return. Among these products, we will study here the Phoenix
Autocall and the Barrier Reverse Convertible. Firstly, we discuss basics, defining
their features and explaining the payoff mechanism. Then, we present numerical
studies for the price of the product by Monte Carlo, and analysis of the Greeks
computed by finite differences based on Monte Carlo prices.
